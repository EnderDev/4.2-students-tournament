## Development

### Compile-it-yourself

#### Step 1

If you are **not** using Windows, you can skip this step.

Ensure you have [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) with the Windows SDK and Desktop Development for C++ components installed.

#### Step 1a

Install the [Rust programming language](https://rust-lang.org). This can be done easiest though the [official Rustup installer](https://rustup.rs/#).

#### Step 2

Ensure Rust has been successfully installed by running `rustc --version` in a terminal. Running this should print out the current version of Rust's compiler, if it doesn't print anything or prints something that looks nothing like a version number: Rust has not installed correctly.
